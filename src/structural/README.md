# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with how objects are composed to form larger structures.

## Patterns and Intentions

The original GoF structural design patterns are:

- **Adapter** - Converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients. The Adapter allows certain classes to work together, which would otherwise be impossible due to their incompatible interfaces.
- **Bridge** - Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator** - Dynamically assigns additional responsibilities to an object. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade** - Provides a unified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- **Flyweight** - Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
- **Proxy** - Provides a representative (surrogate) object or a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
